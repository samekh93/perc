<p>The Chapter of Rose+Croix represents the natural extension of the maturity of a fully functioning Lodge and the elevations of the Lodgeâ€™s qualified membership into the ranks of the Lovers Triad.</p>
  
<blockquote>The members of the Fifth Degree are responsible for all that concerns the Social welfare of the Order. This grade is symbolically that of beauty and harmony; it is the natural stopping-place of the majority of men and women; for to proceed farther, as will appear, involves renunciation of the sternest kind. Here then is all joy, peace, well-being on all planes; the Sovereign Prince Rose Croix is attached equally to the higher and the lower, and forms a natural link between them. Yet let him look to it that his eyes are set on high!</blockquote>
