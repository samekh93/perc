She was a founding member of Sisters of Seshat, a sororal order in Western Traditional Magic. She frequently presents at conferences including Pantheacon, Paganicon, Theurgicon, and the Esoteric Book Conference.

**Our Schedule for March 4, 2017ev**  

**12:30pm: Doors Open**  
**1:00pm: Presentations**  

**Sex, Love and Thelema:**  
*Sex*: Thelemic magick is gendered. Both the priest and the priestess are necessary to accomplish the miracle of the Gnostic Mass. Even so women regularly encounter the idea that men actively work the magick of the system while women passively assist them. We will explore physical gender, magical gender, and gender in the Christian Mass to illuminate gender in the Gnostic Mass.

*Love*: Directed sexual energy accomplishes thaumaturgy. Theurgy responds to the call of Babalon and Nuit – unto me! New formulae construct the framework for women's ritual exploration of the active sex magician role. The gendered magick of Thelema leads us to the realization of our own divinity through the sexual relationship of the human with the divine. 

*Thelema*: At present there are two paths for women in Thelema: to experience the system as men and to represent the divine feminine as the priestess does in the Mass. How can women also walk the path of accomplishment as Thelemic magicians? New ideas suggest avenues for women’s operative magick.

**Creating Consent Culture in the OTO:** This facilitated conversation asks us all to participate in creating a safe and thoughtful environment in our communities through exploring permitted and unpermitted touch.

**Inclusive Thelema:** Like every religion and/or philosophy Thelema develops over time through the lived experience of Thelemites. A series of questions invites us to share our experience and imagine possible futures. Topics we can cover include: post-Crowley Thelema, Woman Friendly Thelema, Race Conscious Thelema, Queer Thelema, Cultural Appropriation, Secrecy, and Promoting Responsible Change. We will decide together where the conversation goes and what we will do next.

**5:00pm-7:00pm:** Dinner break (on your own)

**7:00pm:** Evening ritual and reception
