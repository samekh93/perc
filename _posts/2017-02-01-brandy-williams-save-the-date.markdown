**Cari Fratres, Sorores et Primus!**

*Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.*

Psyche-Eros Rose Croix Chapter would like to invite you to join us at Sekhet-Maat Lodge for a day of presentations by Sister Brandy Williams! 

Our Sister has been an active member of OTO since 2001, enjoying various positions through the years. She has many years of active experience in various magical communities since 1991 and is author of a number of books and anthologies including Ecstatic Ritual: Practical Sex Magic, The Woman Magician: Revisioning Western Metaphysics from a Woman's Perspective and Experience,  and For the Love of the Gods: The History and Modern Practice of Theurgy.

**Presentations will include:** 

**Sex, Love and Thelema:** A presentation focused on OTO and Thelema and how we view gender in terms of: The Gnostic mass, theurgy, womenâ€™s ritual exploration of the active sex magick role and more.

**Creating Consent Culture in the OTO:** This facilitated conversation asks us all to participate in creating a safe and thoughtful environment in our communities through exploring permitted and unpermitted touch.

**Inclusive Thelema:** Like every religion and/or philosophy Thelema develops over time through the lived experience of Thelemites. A series of questions invites us to share our experience and imagine possible futures. Topics we can cover include: post-Crowley Thelema, Woman Friendly Thelema, Race Conscious Thelema, Queer Thelema, Cultural Appropriation, Secrecy, and Promoting Responsible Change. We will decide together where the conversation goes and what we will do next.

This will be an all day event and will likely include a ritual in the evening along with an evening reception.

Proceeds will be collected by the Chapter to support Sekhet-Maat Lodge and its mission to put the word THELEMA on the lips of every person in Portland!

All are encouraged to join us! Sister Brandy will have copies of her book on hand for sales and signing as well.

Mark the date on your calendars NOW! More information and registration for the event coming soon!

*Love is the law, love under will.*
